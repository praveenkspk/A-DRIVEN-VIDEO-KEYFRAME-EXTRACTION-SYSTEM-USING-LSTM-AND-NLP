# A-DRIVEN-VIDEO-KEYFRAME-EXTRACTION-SYSTEM-USING-LSTM-AND-NLP
This project extracts keyframes from videos using LSTM and NLP. It takes a video as input, analyzes visual content using LSTM for temporal patterns, and uses NLP on subtitles or transcripts to find meaningful moments. The output is a set of keyframes that summarize important scenes, aiding video summarization and indexing.
